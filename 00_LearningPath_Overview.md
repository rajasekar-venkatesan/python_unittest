# Python Unit Testing for DS Projects

Hi Everyone, 

I'm planning to have a **5-part self-learn learning path** to help introduce and on-board all of us for python unit testing and how to use perform **Unit test for Data Science** projects.

<br>

The learning path is organized in the following 5 parts:
 1. Introduction to Unit Testing in Python
 2. Testing Functions and Classes in Python
 3. Mocking and Integration Testing
 4. Test Driven Development (TDD)
 5. Advanced Unit Testing Techniques
